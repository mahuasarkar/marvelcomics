Brief Idea about how this project goes:

1. Homepage: 
	- Stack to be used: React(jsx), Next.js, scss
	- based on provided figma design UI
	
2. Under See Marvel Heros:
	- click on card of Marvel Hero
	- triggers => Model
	- Model => display => character details
	
3. Movie Section:
	- From comicvine.gamespot API
	- Stack to be used: ComicvineAPI, ACF, and GraphQL
	- Develop list of comics with Peter Parker
	- additional note: whose series began exclusively in 2022
	
4. Backend with graphQL 
	- Stack to be used: ACF, and GraphQL
	- Data => Add the villans: Doctor Octopus, Carnage, Chameleon, Electro, Green Goblin, Hobgoblin, Kraven the Hunter, Venom, Shocke
	- and stored in provided srdevtest1

5. Dropdown to filter the comics by villan
	- Create a dropdown
	- fetch from [4] 
	- make a connection to GraphQL
	- and filter the comics based on the selection => villan
	
	
Additional notes:
1. Assuming the movie section [3] to be the one just below the banner
	considering it to be comics instead of movie.
	
2. Since its mentioned to display series exclusively in 2022 spiderman,
	considering all the movie section to be comics
	noted, only of Peter Parker whose series began exclusively in 2022 - at first load
	since after looking into comicvine data, choosing 2022 on villan filter results with no daata in many inouts.
	
3. Thus with above 2 points the [2]
	though with this heroes should have been only Peter Parker at first.
	later to be as per villan filters
	
4. In the UI there is no dropdown UI provided
	assuming it to be just above the Comic(Movie just under banner) section
