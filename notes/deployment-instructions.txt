Pre-requisite:

1. VS code: 
	- Go to: https://code.visualstudio.com
	- install
	
2. Node:
	- check for the node and npm version:
		node -v
		# Should show v22.16.0
		
		npm -v
		# Should show 10.5.2
	
	- if not present 
		- install node from https://nodejs.org/en
		- Windows 	=> click the downloaded => .msi
		- Mac 		=> click the downloaded => .pkg
		- Linux 	=> terminal => sudo apt update
								=> sudo apt install nodejs npm
		
	- if present but not the same version
		- Windows 	=> Download the installer	
					=> https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases => .msi
					=> Choose the latest nvm-setup.exe
					=> Run the installer as Administrator
					=> Verify installation in terminal => nvm version
		- Linux/macOS (curl) 	=> curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
								=> restart the terminal
								=> nvm install 22.16.0
								=> nvm use 22.16.0
		- if not the same npm version
					=> npm install -g npm@10.5.2
					
3. Next.js 
	- npm run dev
	#should run the local environment
	
	- if there is error => `Missing script: "dev"`
		- run 			=> npm install next react react-dom
		- package.json	=> add
			"scripts": {
				"dev": "next dev",
				"build": "next build",
				"start": "next start"
			}

Code implementations:
				
1. Use Next.js Starter Template
	- npx create-next-app@latest
	✔ What is your project name? marvelcomics
	✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? No
		- sets complex type safety disabled (no .ts/.tsx files).
	✔ Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
		- enables spell-checker for code
	✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No
		- disabled since using SCSS no need for Tailwind being a utility-first CSS framework 
	✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? No
		- To keep this basic or we would need to use next.config.js
	✔ Would you like to use App Router? No
		- keeping the basic router for now which is Pages Router
	✔ Would you like to Turbopack for `next dev`? No
		- disabled since Project is small/medium-sized, Turbopack is still in development (might encounter bugs)
	✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? No
		- for basics ignornig and keeping it simple for now	
	
2. Move inside this project folder
	- cd marvelcomics
	
3. Install SCSS for styling
	- Run => npm install sass
		- This will include `dependencies` as `saas` in package.json
		- Run => npm list sass
			- To dee dependencies in terminal itself 
4. install next:
	- Run => npm install next react react-dom
	
5. 	Start Your App
	- Run => npm run dev
	
6. Preview on browser
	- http://localhost:3000
	
7. Additional packages:
	Roboto font
	- npm install @fontsource/roboto
	
	Rozha One
	- npm install @fontsource/rozha-one
	
	npm install @apollo/client graphql
			
8. comicvine API:
	- Genrated API key: 52273998fec94ff32bf5468b50e168a9ada75837
	- postman cURL:
		curl --location --request GET 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volumes/?api_key=APIKEY	' \
		--header 'Accept: application/json' \
		--header 'User-Agent: YourAppName/1.0' \
		--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
		--data-urlencode 'api_key=YOUR_API_KEY' \
		--data-urlencode 'format=json'
	
	issues with comicvine API:
		- while fetching comicvine: https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volumes/
		- when filtering with data as documented as start_year to fetch, is not working
			- possible solution to fetch all data and filter in the
		- when filtering with data name as spiderman comics do working
			- a better approch would have been to get the 31 publisher id as filter is not working
			- but as per the documentation publisher id as filter is not working.
			- thus fetching the data named with spiderman
		- also limit is set to 100 max, better approch to loop to get until max 8 datasets
		- still issue persists, sometimes data is not being loaded due to error from comicvine API itself


			
Github installations:
	
	1. 	Download git
		https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

	2.	Run the installer:
		- Check "Add Git to PATH" during installation
		- Use default options for other steps

	3. Check git version
